# Leave Management System
*A Decagon Bootcamp Project by Oyedele Samuel*

A refreshed Decagon Bootcamp project to create a Leave Management System that allows an Admin to be able to create Users; allows users to create leave application, read, update or delete such application and forward to the Admin for approval who in turn reads, update, delete or approves.

## The Admin Panel ##
The admin panel features a simple page with details of how to use the attendant features such as:
- Read leave Applications. 
- Approve or Disapprove Leave application made by staff.
- View all their approval statuses (Pending, Approved, or Disapproved)
- Edit and update leave days (either by shortening the requested leave days based on the discretion of the Management which will be communicated to the staff requesting for such.
- Delete leave applications that are deemed erratic or needless. (For proper documentation purposes, delete is not advised. Rather disapproving the application is proposed as it will allow for historical evaluation of a staff's requests).
> All these above actions can be performed for all at once too by using the buttons designed for such.

- The Admin is also enabled to create new staff profiles and also edit the details of the existing ones or remove the details of one no longer with the establishment.

## The Staff Panel ##
The Staff panel also accessed from the sign-in page shows the profile of the staff with a navbar which lists the options to create leave applications and also view leave applications. The two buttons pops up with their respective forms. 
With the *view leave applications* pop up comes buttons in line to edit and update a leave application that is yet to be approved. You are also free to delete such leave application until it has been approved. If it is not approved then you can edit or delete.

The option to create a leave application makes it possible for you to pick a leave type, choose your start date and your leave end date. This will then be sent to the Admin for approval.

## The Login page
The Admin page takes in 3 parameters: 
- An option to choose whether you are logging in as a staff or the Admin
- Your username
- Your Password

It is however advised that an admin willing to create and track their own leave applications have a staff account created for that purpose as the admin account is expected to be used strictly for overseeing purposes.
