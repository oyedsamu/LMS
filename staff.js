// Our esteemed staff will first see their profiles as a function of the inherited user details
// Then via the navbar buttons, they can create, read, update and delete as desired and allowed.
// The application is seamless as it posts directly to the leaves side of the db.json
// Read or view leaves created by the user does so by checking for all leaves with a particular username.
// Delete or update works same way.
// Delete and update only works if the status is not yet approved.
